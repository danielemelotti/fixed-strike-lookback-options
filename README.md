# Project Description

This repo contains a project on **Fixed Strike Lookback Options**. These derivative instruments are a type of exotic options which allow the holder to "look back" at the asset's price history in order to maximize payoff. The project provides a comprehensive analysis of these kind of options, detailing their payoff structure, pricing formulas, and sensitivity analysis across various parameters, namely:

* underlying asset price
* strike price 
* time to maturity
* volatility
* risk-free interest rate
* dividend yields

The document includes VBA code with the implementation of pricing formulas and graphical representations of price sensitivities, illustrating how these options' value changes with market conditions.
